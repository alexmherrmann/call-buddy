# Contains Operating Systems/Architectures to build. Feel free to add/remove.
#
# Note that the following syntax is
# GOOS GOARCH
# GOOS GOARCH [ALIAS1]
# GOOS GOARCH [ALIAS2]
# ...
#
# ^ The plain "GOOS ARCH" is used in the non-symbolic name (i.e. creates a
#   compiled binary) and the aliases are just symbolic links to the
#   corresponding non-symbolic name
#
# Note: We need the ALIAS because we use the following internally to figure
#       out the OS and architecture when launching call-buddy to hosts on
#       UNIXes:
#
# $ uname -s -m | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
#
# Most uname aliases pulled from, others hand picked:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname
